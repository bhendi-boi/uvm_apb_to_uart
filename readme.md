# UVM Testbench template

## Overview

- This is a generic uvm testbench env intended to be used as a starting point for your next verification project.
- This project assumes you are going to use only one agent i.e; the agent is active.
- Coverage is not included as of now.

## How to use

- Clone this repo using this command
  ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/bhendi-boi/uvm_tb_templates.git
  ```
- Open the cloned directory in your editor of choice.
- Follow the steps laid down below to customise the testbench for your project needs.
- After you are done with these steps, simulate the testbench with `UVM_VERBOSITY` set to `UVM_HIGH`.
- You should be able to see constructed message from all the uvm components.

### Steps

1. Define your interface signals in [interface.sv](interface.sv).
2. Declare interface signals, constraints and `do_print` function in [seq_item](seq_item.sv).
3. Add constraints or remove constraints required in [sequence.sv](sequence.sv).
4. [Optional] Change the [sequencer.sv](sequencer.sv) if required.
5. Fill the `drive` task in [driver.sv](driver.sv).
6. Fill the `sample` task in [monitor.sv](monitor.sv).
7. Fill the `compare` method in [scoreboard.sv](scoreboard.sv). If compare method has to consume some time, refactor it into a task.
8. [Optional] If you've changed analysis port name in scoreboard or monitor, update the same in [env.sv](env.sv) as well.
9. Declare sequences, instantiate them and start them on sequencer in [rand_test.sv](rand_test.sv).
10. Instantiate a dut instance and change the test name if required in [testbench.sv](testbench.sv).
